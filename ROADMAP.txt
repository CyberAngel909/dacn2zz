Gimel Studio Official Roadmap
=============================

Possible features/fixes and ideas about how to possibly implement them.

If you would like to help develop Gimel Studio, you can work on any of these or present your own ideas of how to implement/fix these. Other feature ideas are welcome too. :)


PLANNED FEATURES/FIXES, beta versions
-------------------------------------


Minimum to release v1.0.0 stable
--------------------------------

[High priority]
[] - Reimplement file open/save from v0.4.2
[] - Renderer and Nodes stable
[] - BUG: You must specify an extension in order to export an image
[] - BUG: "to normal map" node - resize auto if image is bigger than req size
[] - BUG: Keyboard shortcuts don't always work on Linux
[] - Float values rather than int (need to create custom sliders as wxpython's doesn't support floats)
[] - Basically re-write the node graph ui code (pseudodc -> dc) so that the graph can be zoomed, etc
[] - Nodes to be able to have more than one output socket
[] - Option to have image as backdrop of Node Graph
[] - Presets: Ability to create your own from selected nodes (Node Groups?)
[] - Multi-monitor support


[Medium priority]
[] - About dialog fixes, licenses 
[] - Node Manager
[] - Only re-render nodes that have values changed (cache nodes themselves)?
[] - 16 bit PNG support, OpenImageIO integration, etc. (transition away from Pillow or a multi-engine renderer)?
[] - GLSL shader support for image manipulation on the GPU (via ModernGL)


[Low priority]
[] - Output node to have Export option in Property Panel
[] - Project templates (ready-made node setups for cropping an image, converting an image to PBR maps, etc)
[] - Keyboard shortcut + menu item for toggling Property Panel
[] - 3D preview for PBR workflow, etc.


[RANDOM STUFF TO WORK ON]:
* References to "plug" need to be changed to "socket" [Low priority]

* Re-implement file opening and saving with error handling
  * Error handing for node versions, support, etc.
  * Support opening old/new files with new/old software versions?


POSSIBLE FUTURE FEATURES/FIXES, version 1.x.x stable
----------------------------------------------------

* Nodes
  * 3D Wireframe/Image node - Renders a 3D wireframe image from a .obj file
  * HDR creation support (node)

* Asset Library?

* Custom widgets/better layout for node property panel [Low priority]

* Print image (export to PDF, etc.) [Low priority]

* Support for other languages (will need help from others) [Low priority]

* Popup image preview window dialog when node is double-clicked, with "before and after" feature [Medium priority]
