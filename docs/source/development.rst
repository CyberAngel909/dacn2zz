Development
===========

This part of the docs explains about the development of Gimel Studio and how you can contribute.


Goals
#####

Here is a little rundown of what the goals of this project are and what they are not at this time. These *may change at any time*, but for now, Gimel Studio will be **focused** into certian areas and avoid other areas entirely.

**Development of Gimel Studio (currently) aims to...**

* include a range of nodes focused on filters, effects, transformations, color grading, etc
* be simple enough for non-technical people to use, yet provide a powerful and streamlined experience for professional editing
* provide fully comprehensive graphical indications in each step of the image editing process.
* give users access to a rich API for scripting custom nodes in Python
* deliever a non-destructive, fast workflow and great user experience.
* support Linux, Windows & MacOs operating systems seamlessly
* support low system hardware requirements (as much as is reasonably possible), so as to be inclusive of even those who don't have super-computers...
* listen to your feedback on these goals :)

**Development of Gimel Studio does not (currently) aim to...**

* provide any drawing and/or painting tools, except "Add text to image", etc
* be a full-blown procedual texture generator, like many node-based programs out there
